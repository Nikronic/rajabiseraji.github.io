The first session was an introduction into the basics of Vue and reactive thinking, along with a sample Todo app in vue. We were exploring componentization of a web page and website in second and third sessions. Finally the students were introduced to Stores in vue, which is implemented in Vuex and became aquainted with the concepts of Actions, Mutations and States. Our course work was put to test in final project, in which the students were tasked to create an interactive homepage for themselves using the introduced concepts.
